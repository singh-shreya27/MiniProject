# Campus Navigation System.

The project aims to develop <b>an intelligent campus navigation system<b> leveraging <b>meta-heuristic search algorithms<b> to optimize multi-modal paths on a university campus.  <br>


 Navigating large campuses efficiently involves finding the best routes across various paths, such as stairs, lifts, and corridors, while considering factors like travel time and individual preferences. Traditional algorithms often struggle to optimize these conflicting objectives.<br>

 Traditional algorithms often struggle to optimize these conflicting objectives. This project harnesses meta-heuristic search algorithms to model the campus as a weighted graph, identifying the most efficient paths. By integrating<b> a multi-objective cost function<b>, the system refines intelligent navigation techniques, offering a practical solution for real-world applications.
